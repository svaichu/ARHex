# Introduction

RHex is a bio-inspired, hexapedal robot designed for locomotion in rough terrain. It can drive over rocks, mud, sand, snow, and railroad tracks. ARHex adds an arm to this configuration, hence the name.

This gives robot, the capability to interact and manipulate objects around it. The endeffector can be modified for pick & place, spraying gun, welding torch, camera, etc. Also the arm can be retracted easily into the base; this would be particularly useful when robot topples as it traverses through rough terrain, where the legged robots are usually deployed.

## Prerequisites

To run the package you need the following installed and configured.
* ROS Melodic Morenia
* Gazebo-9

## Installing

Navigate to `~/catkin_ws/src` your catkin_workspace.

Clone the repository ![build-status](https://travis-ci.com/svaichu/ARHex.svg?branch=master)
```
git clone https://github.com/svaichu/ARHex.git
```
And build the catkin_workspace
```
catkin_make --source src/ARHex
```
Overlay the current catkin_workspace on top of your environment.
```
source devel/setup.bash
```
Load the robot model in Gazebo
```
roslaunch arhex_gazebo arhex.launch
```
In another terminal, start the controllers
```
roslaunch arhex_control arhex_control.launch
```


## Progress

- [x] Model Base and legs
